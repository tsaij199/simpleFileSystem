## Overview
A simplified file-management system implemented in C on Linux. The program simulates file storage in memory and supports creating, searching, opening, editing, and closing files.

Each operation runs in a separate worker thread, with synchronization handled through a mutex, condition variable, and shared command state to prevent race conditions and coordinate execution.
